# ``PekaAPI``

A framework for calling the PEKA API endpoint easily.

## Overview

The aim of this package is to provide a clean API for calling the PEKA API endpoint.
As of creating this document, the endpoint is available under the URL: 
[https://www.peka.poznan.pl/vm/](https://www.peka.poznan.pl/vm/).

To interact with the API, use the ``PekaAPI/PekaAPI`` class.

> Important: Since the framework uses the Swift Concurrency features, it requires at least **Swift 5.5**.
